Available EUD Command Line Options:

MANDATORY parameters from Eclipse Framework needed to ensure proper functioning of EUD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-clearPersistedState
   By default Eclipse 4 persists the current application window model which includes
   view/editor selection, size and position. This clashes with EUD's workspace 
    mechanism, hence it is not desirable to persist this.

-Duser.country=GB -Duser.language=en
   Ensures that formatters use the British system for numbers, etc. which is the
   standard for ESA Software
   
-Dorg.eclipse.update.reconcile=false
   Ensures that error messages related to OSGi bundle installation are not
   raised in the EUD-Log   
      

EUD Logging, debug mode and Tracing
-----------------------------------
Enable EUD verbose debug Logging in the EUD Log
 -Deud.debug=true

                
EUD modes:
----------
Set alternate printing mode
In environments using alternate Linux OS baselines or peculiar remote display
set-ups where the printing can not be done via the normal Eclipse API the alternate 
printing can be activated, which delegates the actual printing to a custom shell script: 
  -Deud.print.script=<PATH_TO_PRINT_SCRIPT>
      where <PATH_TO_PRINT_SCRIPT> is the path to a shell script that will handle the
      printing of the PNG image provided as argument to that script

Enable Domain Lock on specific domain. When Domain Lock is effective, all requests to
the parameter processor service will be forced to the specified domain. So if,
for instance, a displays is opened that contains parameters on domain 0 and
the Domain Lock is set to domain 2, all parameters will be subscribed on
domain 2, even when the displays definition specifies domain 0.
   -Dadapter.monitoring.domainlock=<DOM>
      where <DOM> is the domain ID, e.g. 0, 1, 2, ... 42
      example:
   -Dadapter.monitoring.domainlock=2
      locks the domain to domain 2 for this instance. 

EUD Customizations:
-------------------
Switch GRD anti-aliasing ON/OFF
  -Desa.egos.eud.displays.parameters.grd.charts.antialiasing=1
     where 1 = ON, 0 = OFF

Specify what to show in a MIMIC parameter field as long as no sample 
was received
  -Desa.egos.eud.displays.mimic.no_parameter_value_placeholder=<characters>
     where <characters> is the sequence of characters to show (empty is valid)
     
Specify custom MIMIC Viewer refresh rate in milliseconds
  -Desa.egos.eud.displays.mimic.refresh_rate=<value>
     where <value> is the amount of milliseconds between two refresh cycles
        
Specify custom instance specific identifier in the Window title
  -Deud.instance=<ID>
     where <ID> is an arbitrary String

Specify an simulated time offset
  -Deud.simulatedTimeOffset <OFFSET>
	where <OFFSET> is difference between the simulation time and the current time in milliseconds

Add external jar dependency accessible within EUD via reflection
  -Dosgi.parentClassloader=ext

Add libraries from external dirs
  -Djava.ext.dirs=<PATH>
    where <PATH> specifies the paths where the external jar 
    library directories are (delimited by : (Linux) or ; (Windows))
    NOTE: When the java.ext.dirs is used all default extension directories
          are LOST! For Example the jre/lib/ext directory.
          If libraries from there are needed they need to be listed explicitly
   E.g.: -Djava.ext.dirs=/opt/platform3pp/P3PPmariadb-java-client-1.2.3-1.0:/usr/java/jre1.8.0_72/lib/ext
    
  -classpath <path to file>
  
Activate Remote Audible Alarm
  -Deud.service.alarm.erapServer=<SERVER_HOSTNAME>[:<SERVER_PORT>]
    where <SERVER_HOSTNAME> is the host name or IP address of the EUD Remote Alarm Server
          <SERVER_PORT> optionally the port used by the EUD Remote Alarm Server default is 28007


EUD Preferences override:
-------------------------
The preference defaults are specified in the preferences.ini file contained in
the product plugin. If at deployment time the default of one or multiple
preferences need to be changed, the following can be done:

in the EUD application's directory create a new file with the ending '.ini'
For example: 'default_preferences.ini'

In this file add any combination of the following preferences for the 
storage paths:

# Set default path for the directory containing EUD workspaces
esa.egos.mcs.eud.adapters.persistentstorage.manager/WORKSPACES_DIRECTORY=<SOMEPATH>
# Set default path for the directory containing EUD displays workspaces
esa.egos.mcs.eud.adapters.persistentstorage.manager/PARAM_DISPLAYS_DIRECTORY=<SOMEOTHERPATH>
# Set default path for the directory containing EUD display-lists workspaces
esa.egos.mcs.eud.adapters.persistentstorage.manager/DISPLAYS_LIST_DIRECTORY=<YETSOMEOTHERPATH>


Then, edit the 'EGOS_UD.ini' file and add right at the top of the file
the following entry, which points to the preference file you just created:

-pluginCustomization
default_preferences.ini

The way it works is as follows:
1) At the startup of Elcipse RCP framework, the 'EGOS_UD.ini' file is read.
2) the entry "-pluginCustomization" is found and Eclipse locates the 
indicated .ini file and reads it.
3) Every entry found in the referenced .ini is read and overrides the 
default preference value that is specified inside the application.
